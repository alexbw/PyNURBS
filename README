## NURBS - Non Uniform Rational B-Splines.

This python module is a revival and update of Runar Tenfjord's NURBS toolbox, which itself
is a port of Mark Spink's SCILAB/MATLAB tolbox to python with help of numpy.

#### Dependency
============
Python 2.0 or above
NumPy
Dislin -> optional but recomended
PyOpenGL -> optional

#### Installation
============
Run 
```python setup.py install```

#### License
=======
Runar Tenfjord originally relased this package under the GPL Version 2 license, 
so I suppose that means it has to stay that way.
